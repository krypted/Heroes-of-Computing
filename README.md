# Heroes-of-Computing
A template for an iOS sticker pack app (or compile and use the stickers in it)

# Xcode Project To Create Sticker Apps
This repo contains the Xcode Project to use as a sticker app. Simply download, open the project, replace the stickers in Xcode (the ones here can be deleted in Xcode or from the "Sticker Pack.stickerpack" directory), and replace the iMessage App Icon.stickerpack for a new app icon (what you see in the Stickers slider from Messages). Will need certs from your Apple ID as well. Can be run on a device from Xcode or should be sufficient to submit to the App Store provided the content meets the developer requirements.
